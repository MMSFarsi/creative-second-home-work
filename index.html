        <br>
    <p>England escaped an embarrassing last 16 exit at Euro 2024 thanks to Jude Bellingham's overhead kick before Harry Kane struck in extra-time for a 2-1 win over Slovakia Sunday.

        The Three Lions have been hyped as one of the favorites to end a 58-year wait for major tournament glory but looked set to go out with a whimper to Ivan Schranz's 25th minute goal.
        
        However, Bellingham's moment of inspiration five minutes into six added on in stoppage time breathed new life into Gareth Southgate's reign as England boss.</p>
   <br>
        <p>Kane then headed in just a minute into extra-time to set up a quarter-final meeting with Switzerland Saturday.

            Southgate looked certain to fall on his sword after steadfastly refusing to make changes to a side that stumbled through as winners of Group C despite scoring just two goals in three games.
            
            Kobbie Mainoo was introduced for his first competitive start in Southgate's only change and he paid the price with another lackluster display lacking in any speed or invention for long spells.</p>
       <br>
        <p>The one saving grace of England's performances in the group stage was that a makeshift defence had held up well, conceding just once in three games.

            However, they were torn to pieces early on by a Slovakia side ranked 45th in the world.
            
            England did not heed a couple of warnings as David Hancko and Lukas Haraslin were wasteful with big chances.
            
            Slovakia finally punished their more illustrious opponents when David Strelec was given acres of room to turn and play in Schranz, who confidently stroked past Jordan Pickford for his third goal of the tournament.</p>
         <br>
         <p>Despite his lack of experience, Mainoo was one of the few players that threatened to spark England into life as the Manchester United midfielder's effort was deflected wide.

            The half-time whistle was met with a chorus of boos but Southgate still stuck to his guns and did not make a change until 25 minutes to go.
            
            England did at least improve on a dismal first half and had the ball in the net within five minutes of the restart.
            
            Phil Foden turned in Kieran Trippier's cross but was caught offside after a Video Assistant Referee review.</p>   
            <h3>RESULT</h3>
            <p><i>England 2 (Bellingham 90+5, Kane 91) Slovakia 1 (Schranz 25) aet</i></p>
